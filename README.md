Prediction of job satisfaction and probability of resignation of employees based on HR data (ML)
HR analytics helps businesses increase employee productivity and monitor turnover. My task was to assist the HR analytics team in doing their work more quickly and efficiently. First, I was able to build a model that, based on the customerâ€™s data, predicts the level of employee job satisfaction within the company. The next task was to build a model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company. As a result, I was able to compile recommendations for managers on how to structure HR processes.
